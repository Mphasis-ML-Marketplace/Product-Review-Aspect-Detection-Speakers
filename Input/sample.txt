Checked my 100mbps speed getting 100mbps download and 100mbps upload speed on 5GHz and getting 98mbps both download and upload on 2.4GHz. Not found any speed drops in the middle. Not found any disconnection. Easy setup and device software updated over wi-fi. Getting good range of signal. Connected 4 phones and 3 laptops at a time played UHD videos without lag. Really worth for the price.
